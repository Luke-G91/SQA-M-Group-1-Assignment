# Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup

1. Launch the application using Docker

   To start the entire stack quickly using a postgres container and the app container, which will be avaliable [here](http://localhost:1234/)

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Local Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   To install the necessary packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables

  - `PORT` (optional, defaults to 3000)
  - `SESSION_SECRET`

    Generate by using the following command:

    ```bash
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
    ```

3. **Starting the Application**

- To start the app with a local SQLite database, execute

  ```bash
  npm run start:local
  ```

- If you prefer using a different database, specify a connection string in the `.env` file using the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

4. **Optional: PostgreSQL Setup via Docker**

- To start a PostgreSQL database using Docker, run

  ```bash
  docker-compose up postgres
  ```

- Use the following connection URL in your `.env` file

  ```text
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase
  ```

5. **Accessing the Application**
   - The application will be accessible on the defined localhost port. Users will need to register an account upon first access.

### Running Tests

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tests**

  ```bash
  npm run test:bdd
  ```

- **Unit and Integration Tests**

  ```bash
  npm run test:jest
  ```

- **All Tests**

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

## Features

- **Login Flow:** Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Blog Search and Home Page Improvements:** Enhanced user interface and search functionality.

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                 | Risk                                                                                                                        | Solution                                                                                                                     |

| Implementing secure login | User details including passwords are accessible that and anyone can access anyone else's account                            | Used bcrypt for password hashing and CSRF protection.                                                                        |
| SQL injection             | Database queries such as blog post search could allow SQL queries to be added to the search to leak or modify database data | Sequlize uses paramteised queries which safely escape and inject parameters to prevent malicious alteration of the SQL query |

## Evidence for Marking Criteria

### Feature Implementation

Description: 
This blog application offers key features for an enhanced user experience. Users can search for posts by keywords, blog name, or author, with the option to clear their search. They can like posts to show appreciation and comment to foster discussions, with the ability to edit their comments. A secure login and registration system ensures user data protection, allowing registered users to access interactive features like liking and commenting.

- **Code Reference:** 

The code implements a registration feature, securely hashing user passwords with bcrypt, saving user details via a controller, and redirecting to the login page upon successful registration. (feature.png)

The code implements a like feature, enabling logged-in users to toggle likes on blog posts and returning the updated like status and count in real-time.(feature-2.png) 

The code implements a comment feature, enabling users to write and submit comments on specific blog posts, which are saved with user and post details.(feature-3.png)


The code implements a search feature, allowing users to find blog posts by title or author, with the option to clear the search query and a message displayed when no blogs of that type are found. (feature-4.png)
