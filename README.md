# Setup Instructions

### Quick Setup

1. Launch the application using Docker

   To start the entire stack quickly using a postgres container and the app container, which will be avaliable [here](http://localhost:1234/)

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Local Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   To install the necessary packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables

  - `PORT` (optional, defaults to 3000)
  - `SESSION_SECRET`

    Generate by using the following command:

    ```bash
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
    ```

3. **Starting the Application**

- To start the app with a local SQLite database, execute

  ```bash
  npm run start:local
  ```

- If you prefer using a different database, specify a connection string in the `.env` file using the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

4. **Optional: PostgreSQL Setup via Docker**

- To start a PostgreSQL database using Docker, run

  ```bash
  docker-compose up postgres
  ```

- Use the following connection URL in your `.env` file

  ```text
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase
  ```

5. **Accessing the Application**
   - The application will be accessible on the defined localhost port. Users will need to register an account upon first access.

- **Sample Code References:**
  - **User Authentication and Password Security**: [userController.js](./controllers/userController.js)
    Implements secure user authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and comparison. This prevents storing plaintext passwords and ensures secure login verification through cryptographic hashing.
    ```javascript
    // User authentication with secure password comparison
    exports.authUser = async (email, password, done) => {
      const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashedPassword);
      // ...
    };
    ```

  - **Blog Search and Filtering**: [blogPostController.js](./controllers/blogPostController.js)
    Provides case-insensitive search functionality across blog titles, content, and author names. Uses Sequelize's secure query parameters to prevent SQL injection while enabling flexible search capabilities.
    ```javascript
    // Case-insensitive search across multiple fields
    exports.getAllBlogPosts = async (searchQuery = "") => {
      const blogs = await BlogPost.findAll({
        where: {
          [Op.or]: [
            Sequelize.where(
              Sequelize.fn("LOWER", Sequelize.col("title")),
              "LIKE",
              `%${searchQuery.toLowerCase()}%`
            ),
            // ...
          ],
        },
      });
    };
    ```

  - **Comment Management**: [blogPostController.js](./controllers/blogPostController.js)
    Handles comment creation and validation with proper error handling and security checks. Ensures comments meet length requirements and are associated with authenticated users.
    ```javascript
    exports.addComment = async (commentData) => {
      // Basic validation
      if (!commentData || typeof commentData.comment !== "string") {
        throw new Error("Comment text is required");
      }
      const trimmedComment = commentData.comment.trim();
      if (trimmedComment.length > 500) {
        throw new Error("Comment cannot exceed 500 characters");
      }
      // ...
    };
    ```

  - **Database Schema Relations**: [models/index.js](./models/index.js)
    Establishes relationships between different entities in the application using Sequelize associations. Creates a proper data structure for users, posts, likes, and comments with appropriate foreign keys.
    ```javascript
    User.belongsToMany(BlogPost, {
      through: BlogLike,
      foreignKey: "userId",
      otherKey: "blogId",
    });
    BlogPost.hasMany(BlogComment, {
      foreignKey: 'blogId',
      as: 'comments'
    });
    ```

  - **Environment Configuration**: [config/database.js](./config/database.js)
    Manages different database configurations based on the application environment. Supports development with SQLite, testing with in-memory database, and production with PostgreSQL.
    ```javascript
    if (env === "test") {
      sequelize = new Sequelize({
        dialect: "sqlite",
        storage: ":memory:",
        logging: false
      });
    }
    ```

  - **User Input Validation**: [controllers/utils/validateUserData.js](./controllers/utils/validateUserData.js)
    Implements comprehensive validation for user registration data. Checks for proper email format, password strength, and required fields while preventing malicious inputs.
    ```javascript
    function validateUserData(userData) {
      if (!isValidEmail(userData.email)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid email format');
      }
      if (!isStrongPassword(userData.password)) {
        throw new Error('Password does not meet security requirements');
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
